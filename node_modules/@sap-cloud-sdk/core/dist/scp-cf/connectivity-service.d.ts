/**
 * Given a destination and a JWT (required for subscriber destinations), this function will add a proxy configuration to a destination.
 * See also [[ProxyConfiguration]].
 *
 * This function will reject if no connectivity service is bound, no XSUAA service with plan application is bound or the client credentials grant with the XSUAA service fails.
 *
 * @Deprecated In version 1.16.0 web proxy support was added so this method was renamed to addProxyConfigurationOnPrem to better distinguish the two cases.
 *
 * @param destination - The destination to which the proxy configuration should be added.
 * @param jwt - The JWT of the current user.
 * @returns A promise resolving to the destiation with the added proxy configuration.
